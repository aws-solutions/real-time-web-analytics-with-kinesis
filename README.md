# Real-Time Web Analytics with Kinesis Data Analytics
AWS Solution for analyzing web traffic in real-time using Kinesis Data Analytics, an S3 website, and Amazon Cognito.

## OS/Python Environment Setup
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install install zip wget gawk sed -y
```

## Building Lambda Package
```bash
cd deployment
./build-s3-dist.sh source-bucket-base-name
```
source-bucket-base-name should be the base name for the S3 bucket location where the template will source the Lambda code from.
The template will append '-[region_name]' to this value.
For example: ./build-s3-dist.sh solutions
The template will then expect the source code to be located in the solutions-[region_name] bucket

## CF template and Lambda function
Located in deployment/dist
